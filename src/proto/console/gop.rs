//! Graphics output protocol.
//!
//! The UEFI GOP is meant to replace existing VGA hardware.
//! It can be used in the boot environment as well at runtime,
//! until a high-performance driver is loaded by the OS.
//!
//! The GOP provides access to a hardware frame buffer and allows UEFI apps
//! to draw directly to the graphics output device.
//!
//! The advantage of the GOP over legacy VGA is that it allows multiple GPUs
//! to exist and be used on the system. There is a GOP implementation for every
//! unique GPU in the system which supports UEFI.
//!
//! # Definitions
//!
//! All graphics operations use a coordinate system where
//! the top-left of the screen is mapped to the point (0, 0),
//! and `y` increases going down.
//!
//! Rectangles are defined by their top-left corner, and their width and height.
//!
//! The stride is understood as the length in bytes of a scan line / row of a buffer.
//! In theory, a buffer with a width of 640 should have (640 * 4) bytes per row,
//! but in practice there might be some extra padding used for efficiency.
