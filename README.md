# uefi-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GabrielMajeri/uefi-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GabrielMajeri/uefi-rs)

This library allows you to write [UEFI][uefi] applications in Rust.

UEFI is the successor to the BIOS. It provides an early boot environment for OS loaders
and other low-level applications.

The objective of this library is to provide **safe** and **performant** wrappers for UEFI
interfaces, and allow developers to write idiomatic Rust code.

**Note**: due to some issues with the Rust compiler, this crate currently works
and has been tested _only_ with **64-bit** UEFI.

## Project structure

This project contains multiple sub-crates:

- `uefi` (top directory): defines the standard UEFI tables / interfaces. The objective is to stay unopionated
  and safely wrap most interfaces.

- `uefi-services`: initializes many convenience crates:
  - `uefi-logger`: wrapper for the standard [logging](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/log) crate.
  Prints log output to console. No buffering is done: this is not a high-performance logger.
  - `uefi-alloc`: implements a global allocator using UEFI functions.
  This allows you to allocate objects on the heap.
  There's no guarantee of the efficiency of UEFI's allocator.
  
  Since the global logger / allocator **can only be set once** per binary, if you're building
  a real OS you will want to either:
    - provide your own logger / allocator, using _your_ kernel's systems
    - use UEFI for writing an OS-specific boot loader binary, while your kernel is a separate binary, packaged
      together with the boot loader: similar to what the Linux kernel's [EFI stub] does

- `uefi-exts`: extends existing UEFI objects by providing utility functions for common API usage.
  Requires the `alloc` crate (either use `uefi-alloc` or your own custom allocator).

- `uefi-test-runner` a UEFI application that runs unit / integration tests.

## Documentation

This crate's documentation is fairly minimal, and you are encouraged to refer to
the [UEFI specification][spec] for detailed information.

[spec]: http://www.uefi.org/specifications

### rustdoc

Use the `build.py` script in the `uefi-test-runner` directory to generate the documentation:

```sh
./build.py doc
```

## Sample code

An example UEFI app is built in the `uefi-test-runner` directory.

Check out the testing [README.md](uefi-test-runner/README.md) for instructions on how to run the crate's tests.

This repo also contains a `x86_64-uefi.json` file, which is a custom Rust target for 64-bit UEFI applications.

## Building UEFI programs

For instructions on how to create your own UEFI apps, see the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file.
