//! Graphics output protocol.
//!
//! The UEFI GOP is meant to replace existing [VGA][vga] hardware interfaces.
//! It can be used in the boot environment as well as at runtime,
//! until a high-performance driver is loaded by the OS.
//!
//! The GOP provides access to a hardware frame buffer and allows UEFI apps
//! to draw directly to the graphics output device.
//!
//! The advantage of the GOP over legacy VGA is that it allows multiple GPUs
//! to exist and be used on the system. There is a GOP implementation for every
//! unique GPU in the system which supports UEFI.
//!
//! This protocol _can_ be used after boot services are exited.
//!
//! [vga]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array
//!
//! # Definitions
//!
//! All graphics operations use a coordinate system where the top-left of the screen
//! is mapped to the point (0, 0), and `y` increases going down.
//!
//! Rectangles are defined by their top-left corner, and their width and height.
//!
//! The stride is understood as the length in bytes of a scan line / row of a buffer.
//! In theory, a buffer with a width of 640 should have (640 * 4) bytes per row,
//! but in practice there might be some extra padding used for efficiency.
//!
//! Frame buffers represent the graphics card's image buffers, backing the displays.
//!
//! Blits (**bl**ock **t**ransfer) can do high-speed memory copy between
//! the frame buffer and itself, or to and from some other buffers.
//!
//! # Blitting
//!
//! On certain hardware, the frame buffer is in a opaque format,
//! or cannot be accessed by the CPU. In those cases, it is not possible
//! to draw directly to the frame buffer. You must draw to another buffer
//! with a known pixel format, and then submit a blit command to copy that buffer
//! into the back buffer.
//!
//! Blitting can also copy a rectangle from the frame buffer to
//! another rectangle in the frame buffer, or move data out of the frame buffer
//! into a CPU-visible buffer. It can also do very fast color fills.
//!
//! The source and destination rectangles must always be of the same size:
//! no stretching / squashing will be done.
//!
//! # Animations
//!
//! UEFI does not mention if double buffering is used, nor how often
//! the frame buffer gets sent to the screen, but it's safe to assume that
//! the graphics card will re-draw the buffer at around the monitor's refresh rate.
//! You will have to implement your own double buffering if you want to
//! avoid tearing with animations.
