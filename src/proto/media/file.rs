//! This module provides the `File` structure, representing an opaque handle to a
//! directory / file, as well as providing functions for opening new files.
//!
//! Usually a file system implementation will return a "root" file, representing
//! `/` on that volume, and with that file it is possible to enumerate and open
//! all the other files on that volume.
